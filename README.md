# Hello_World
My introductory blog about my life, my projects, and my goals.

December 19, 2015
Today I woke up at around 7:40ish. I did my normal morning routine. I attempted to start the day with a healthy diet plan I found at darebee.com but chose not to. I took the long overdue quiz of Data Science Toolkit Course on Coursera for Week 1 and plan to take Week 2 quiz on time this Sunday (12/19/2015). ALong with computer science (and data science) related stuff, I need to study for my academic classes and ensure an increase in my GPA. Right now, I plan to learn more about GitHub and continue on with lectures from Coursera.
